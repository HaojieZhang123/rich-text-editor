WYSIWYG rich text editor

This is part of my personal practice projects to get familiar with web developing

I'll try creating a functioning WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) rich text editor, inspired by Microsoft Office Word 2019's design.

I'll be using only HTML, CSS and JS. The objective is to learn without the help of external libraries.
