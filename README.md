WYSIWYG rich text editor

This is part of my personal practice projects to get familiar with web developing

I'll try creating a functioning WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) rich text editor, inspired by Microsoft Office Word 2019's design.

I'll be using only HTML, CSS and JS. The objective is to learn without the help of external libraries.

Need work:
Find a way to display with page is being actively written on in every instance

Needed:
insert table
insert image given url

It's possible to know the selection starting and ending potition with the property selectionStart and selectionEnd. It is so possible to know the user cursor position inside the text editor with selection start.

Find a way to insert table and image on the cursor's position
